Device 0 on the bus list is the default master. Make that the CPU.

Each device gets polled once per cycle
Adding a device to a bus sets the bus on the device 
Responders should put the requested address in the response message

Bus Sequence:
 1. Poll the master
 2. Loop over the other devices: run then poll
 3. Run the master
 4. Clear the queue
